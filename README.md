Task 1:
This task involves the following steps:
• Inserting two rebar reinforcement rods into position in the steel baseplate – 5 points each (10 points
total)
• Installing the frame onto the baseplate – 20 points
• Removing a pin to release the chains holding the frame – 5 points
• Transporting and positioning the hose for pouring concrete into the frame – 10 points
• Retrieving the three positioning beacons and returning them to the surface – 5 points each (15
points total)
TOTAL POINTS = 60

Task 2:
This task involves the following steps:
• Disconnecting the power cable from the platform – 5 points
• Turning the valve to stop the flow of water to the platform – 10 points
• Disengaging the locking mechanism at the base of the fountain – 5 points
• Removing the old fountain – 5 points
• Installing the new fountain – 5 points
• Re-engaging the locking mechanism at the base of the fountain – 5 points
• Turning the valve to restore the flow of water to the platform – 10 points
• Reconnecting the power cable to the platform – 10 points
• Returning the old fountain to the surface, side of the pool – 5 points
TOTAL POINTS = 60

Task 3:
This task involves the following steps:
• Using a simulated Raman spectrometer to determine if contaminants are present in two areas – 5
points
• Collecting samples from the contaminated area
o Collecting two clams from the contaminated area and returning them to the surface – 5
points each (10 points total)
o Collecting a sediment sample from the contaminated area and returning it to the surface –
up to 30 points
 100 ml or more of agar – 30 points
 Less than 100 ml but more than 10 ml– 10 points
 less than 10 ml of agar – 0 points
• Placing a cap over the contaminated area – 15 points
Total points = 60

Task 4:
This task involves the following steps:
• Locating the four cargo containers – 5 points
• Inserting the sensor into the port on the side of each container to activate the RFID – 5 points each
(20 points total)
• Using the RFID data to determine the containers identification number, contents, and if the contents
are high risk – 5 points each (20 points total)
• Attaching a buoy marker to the U-bolt on the container with the highest-risk cargo – 10 points
• Determining the direction and distance, within 10 cm, from the highest-risk container to the other
three containers – 5 points each (15 points total)
2017 RANGER Class 25
• Using the distance and direction to make a survey map of the incident site – 10 points
Total points = 80

Total 260 Points
